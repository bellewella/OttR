## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Introverse is a package that provides documentation that can be understood by people who don't have experience programming! You can read about it in this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/stephspiel/status/1430200830527950856), and here is the [Github page](https://spielmanlab.github.io/introverse/)


# 1. Install introverse
```{r}
remotes::install_github("spielmanlab/introverse")
```

If you run this line of code and receive the error,

> Error in loadNamespace(name) : there is no package called ‘remotes’

This error means you first need to install the remotes package to be able to install the introverse. Copy/paste the line of code below into an R Console, and then try the code remotes::install_github("spielmanlab/introverse") again.

```{r}
install.packages("remotes") 
```

If you did not receive that error, introverse has been installed properly.

# 2. Load the package
```{r}
library(introverse)
```
# 3. Test it out!
```{r}
show_topics()
```

```{r}
show_categories()
```

```{r}
show_topics("readr")
```

```{r}
get_help("read_csv")
```
The help page should pop up in the "Viewer" panel! 

Let's compare this help page with the default documentation. 
```{r}
?read_csv
```

Let's try checking out some documentation for ggplot
```{r}
get_help("geom_boxplot")
```
